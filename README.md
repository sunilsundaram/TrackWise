# TrackWise

Managing expenses oftentimes feels like a hassle. We require an appropriate budget in order to handle cash inflow and outflow. This project would facilitate the task using an application, Trackwise. This application was developed with the fundamental purpose of catering to the budget needs of users. Initially, the users would have to create an account with the application and will subsequently gain access by logging into the application. In addition to setting up a budget, Trackwise enables users to add and delete expenditures; thereby enabling them to maintain track of their expenses. Multiple user accounts can be created and can have their expenses recorded. Moreover, the application aids users in  viewing their balances and providing an alert when their expenses exceed the set budget.  Kotlin is the underlying programming language used for this application. Kotlin was chosen as it provides concise lines of code when compared to Java, thus enhancing the development process of our application. 

# To run the application:
- Download the IntelliJ IDEA from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
- Create a Kotlin project
- Replace "src/main/kotlin/Main.kt" file in the new project directory with this project's Main.kt
- Build and run the project
